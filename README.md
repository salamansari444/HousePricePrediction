House Price Prediction
--------------------------------------------
we propose our system “Real Estate Price Prediction”. House is one of 
human life's most essential needs, along with other fundamental needs such as food, 
water, and much more. Demand for houses grew rapidly over the years as people's living 
standards improved. An increase in house demand occurs each year, indirectly causing 
house price increases every year. The problem arises when there are numerous variables 
such as location and property demand that may influence the house price, thus most 
stakeholders including buyers and developers, housebuilders, and the real estate industry 
would like to know the exact attributes or the accurate factors influencing the house price 
to help investors make decisions and help housebuilders set the house price. Real Estate 
Price Prediction can be done using multiple prediction models (Machine Learning Model) 
such as support vector regression, artificial neural network, etc. There are many benefits 
that home buyers, property investors, and housebuilders can reap from the house-price 
model. This model will provide a lot of information and knowledge to home buyers, 
property investors, and housebuilders, such as the valuation of house prices in the present
market, which will help them determine house prices. The target feature in this proposed 
model is the price of the real estate property and the independent features are: no. of 
bedrooms, carpet area, the floor, car parking, and lift availability. The whole 
implementation is done using the python programming language
